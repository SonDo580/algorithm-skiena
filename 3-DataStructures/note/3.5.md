## 3.5. Priority Queue

Each element in a priority queue has a priority associated with it.

### Basic 3 operations

- Insert(x): insert x with a key (priority) into the queue
- Find-Min() / Find-Max(): return a pointer to the item which has the largest / smallest key (priority).
- Delete-Min() / Delete-Max(): remove the item which has the largest / smallest key (priority).

### Basic implementations

**Problem:**
What is the worst-case time complexity of the 3 basic priority queue
operations when the basic data structure is

- An unsorted array.
- A sorted array.
- A balanced binary search tree

**Answer:**

1. Insert(x)

- unsorted array: O(1) - insert at the end
- sorted array: O(n) - find the correct place, shift elements
- balanced binary search tree: O(log n) - find the correct place plus some constant pointer manipulations

2. Find-Minimum()

Trick: use a pointer for the minimum entry, update on insert if needed.

- unsorted array: O(1)
- sorted array: O(1)
- balanced binary search tree: O(1)

2. Delete-Minimum()
   Trick: from the pointer for the minimum entry, remove the entry, then do a search for the next minimum.

- unsorted array: O(n)
- sorted array: O(1)
- balanced binary search tree: O(log n)
