## 3.8. Specialized data structures

1. **String data structures**

- Character strings are typically represented by array of characters.
- Suffix trees/arrays: pre-process strings to make pattern matching operations faster. See `Section 12.3`

2. **Geometric data structures**

- Geometric data: consists of collections of data points and regions.
- Regions in plane: described by polygons, where the boundary of the polygon is given by a chain of line segments.
- Polygons: represented using an array of points (v1,... , vn, v1) such that (vi, vi+1) is a segment of the boundary.
- kd-trees: See `Section 12.6`

3. **Graph data structures**

- Represented with adjacency matrices or adjacency lists. See `Chapter 6` and `Section 12.4`

4. **Set data structures**

- See `Section 12.5` and `Section 6.1.3`
