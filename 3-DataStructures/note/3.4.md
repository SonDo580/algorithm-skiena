## 3.4. Binary Search Tree

For any node x

- all the nodes on the left subtree of x have keys < x
- all the nodes on the right subtree of x have keys > x
  -> implication: no duplicate keys

### Implementations

See `code/binary-search-tree.c`

### Analysis

- When implemented using binary search tree, all 3 dictionary operations takes O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree.
- The smallest height occurs when the tree is perfectly balanced: h = log2(n)
- With the insert-at-leaf-node algorithm, if we insert the keys in sorted order, the height of the tree will be h = n
- But the probability that the resulting tree will have O(log(n)) height is high (`Section 4.6`).

### Balanced search tree

Implementation: `Section 12.1`

### Exploit balanced search tree

**Problem:**

- Read n numbers and print them in sorted order.
- You have access to a balanced dictionary data structure, which supports the operations search, insert, delete, minimum, maximum, successor, predecessor each in O(log n) time.

1. Sort in O(n\*log(n)) time using only insert and in-order traversal?
2. Sort in O(n\*log(n)) time using only minimum, successor, and
   insert?
3. Sort in O(n\*log(n)) time using only minimum, insert, delete,
   search?

**Answer:**

1. Sort1

with `insert` and `in-order traverse`

```
t = initialize-tree()
while(input):
  read(x)
  insert(x, t)
in-order-traverse(t)
```

2. Sort2

with `insert`, `min`, `successor`

```
t = initialize-tree()
while(input):
  read(x)
  insert(x, t)

y = min(t)
while(y != NULL):
  print(y->value)
  y = successor(y, t);
```

2. Sort3

with `min`, `insert`, `delete`, `search`

```
t = initialize-tree()
while(input):
  read(x)
  insert(x, t)

y = min(t)
while(y != NULL):
  print(y->value)
  delete(y, t)
  y = min(t);
```
